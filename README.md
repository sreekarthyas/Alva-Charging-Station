# Alva-Charging-Station
📊 EV Charging Analytics Dashboard – Power BI + Big Data (Hadoop + MapReduce)
🚀 Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing large-scale raw log data collected from multiple energy sources including solar, diesel, and portable modules powering EV charging stations. The goal is to extract valuable insights to enhance operational efficiency and sustainability.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Big Data Processing: Hadoop, Java MapReduce

Data Visualization: Power BI

Data Format: CSV (cleaned and structured)

📌 Process Summary:
Raw log data was processed using Hadoop and custom Java MapReduce jobs to handle scale and complexity.

The processed data was cleaned, structured, and exported as a CSV file.

The CSV was imported into Power BI for creating an interactive and insightful dashboard.

📈 Key Features:
🔍 Monitor Charging Station Performance

🛠️ Identify Maintenance Requirements

💰 Analyze Revenue and Utilization Efficiency

🌱 Evaluate Environmental Impact (CO₂ saved, renewable usage, fuel avoided)
